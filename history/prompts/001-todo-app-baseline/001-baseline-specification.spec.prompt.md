## Prompt

```text
Define the baseline specifications for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application.

Always run backend API with this command: "fastapi dev <file-name.py>"

====================================
FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS
====================================

Task Features:
- Create task
- View all tasks
- Update task
- Delete task
- Toggle task completion

Each task must:
- Belong to a single authenticated user
- Be inaccessible to other users

====================================
API SPECIFICATIONS
====================================

All endpoints:
- Are prefixed with /api/
- Require JWT authentication
- Filter data by authenticated user

Endpoints:
- GET    /api/{user_id}/tasks
- POST   /api/{user_id}/tasks
- GET    /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
- PUT    /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
- DELETE /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}
- PATCH  /api/{user_id}/tasks/{id}/complete

====================================
AUTHENTICATION SPECIFICATION
====================================

- Better Auth runs on frontend
- JWT tokens are issued on login
- Tokens sent via Authorization header
- Backend verifies token using shared secret
- Backend extracts user identity from JWT
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully created baseline specification for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application on branch `001-todo-app-baseline`.

**Specification Structure**:
- 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P6) covering authentication through task deletion
- 24 functional requirements organized across 4 domains (Auth, Task Management, Data Validation, Multi-User Isolation)
- 10 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- 7 edge cases identified
- 2 key entities defined (User, Task)
- Comprehensive assumptions documented

**Key Design Decisions**:
- User stories prioritized for independent implementation (P1: Auth foundation → P2: Read → P3-P6: Write operations)
- Multi-user isolation enforced at multiple levels (FR-011, FR-021, FR-022, FR-024, SC-004)
- Task data bounded (title 200 chars, description 2000 chars) to prevent abuse
- JWT token expiration assumed at 24 hours (adjustable in planning)
- Task deletion is permanent (no soft delete in baseline)

**Validation Results**: All quality checks passed
- ✅ Zero implementation details leaked
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (reasonable defaults documented)
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria technology-agnostic with measurable metrics
- ✅ Complete acceptance scenarios for all user stories

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established complete, validated baseline specification defining 6 independently testable user stories with comprehensive functional requirements and success criteria
- 🧪 Tests: None (specification document - testing defined in acceptance scenarios)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-todo-app-baseline/spec.md (200 lines), specs/001-todo-app-baseline/checklists/requirements.md (validation checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to design technical architecture, or `/sp.clarify` if any ambiguities discovered
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification demonstrates strong quality with clear prioritization, comprehensive multi-user isolation requirements, and realistic success criteria. Made informed decisions on JWT expiration, password requirements, and data limits using industry standards to avoid unnecessary clarifications.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification complete with zero clarification gaps
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist validation - PASSED all items (Content Quality, Requirement Completeness, Feature Readiness)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify with detailed monorepo structure, API endpoints, and authentication flow provided
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor constitution compliance during planning phase to verify architectural constraints (Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Better Auth, Neon PostgreSQL) are correctly applied
